This is a simple simulation of a webservice to get (fake) real-time car park availabilty. Call the service at

http://suzannelittle.pythonanywhere.com/carpark/<location>

where location can be one of the following:
    Multistorey (CP1): multistorey
    Creche (CP2): creche
    Invent (CP3): invent
    Library (CP4): library
    St Pats CP: StPats
    DCU Alpha CP: alpha

The service will remove capitalisation and spaces so variations should also work. The service returns JSON with a number ("spaces_available") showing the free spaces in car park ("carpark_name") at "timestamp".

Example: "{"timestamp": "12:15:44", "carpark_name": "creche", "spaces_available": 92}"

There's also a service that randomly returns different errors or incorrect results called "badpark".

You should also be prepared to handle future changes and updates to the service.
